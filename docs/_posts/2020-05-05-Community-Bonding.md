## Week-1
The first week was spent in having an intitial meeting with my mentor in which we discussed how out project was going to be organized. I was  asked to create this blog using Jekyll minimal mistakes template and briefed about how to maintain it. We also discussed about our weekly meetings and how we should keep track of our development progess. I was given access to the the required repositories on GitHub and had a look at the previous prototype of the VisualCircuit Tool. I also had read the code-base of the IceStudio tool, as some of its modules are to be used by our tool.

## Week-2
During the second week, I was asked to develop a basic functioning prototype of the front-end in Node.js by using IceStudio as a starting point. Unfortunately I ran into some installation issues with IceStudio. I made an issue on the IceStudio repository:
https://github.com/FPGAwars/icestudio/issues/410. 

Then I started working on next week's task which was to create a basic prototype of the Python back-end using threads. It consisted on implementing basic Python driver blocks and setting up appropriate connections using wires.
The issue and the pull request can be found on:
https://github.com/JdeRobot/VisualCircuit/issues/13

## Week-3
During the third week, the threaded application was to be converted into a multi-process based solution as Python threading module does not support multiple cores due to Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).
