# NodeJS Application

The work I did week was mostly making enhancements to the project, developing a website and writing documentation. There is not much to write in this post as everything can be seen the the links referenced with each point. The work I did this week was:

- Removed all IceStudio components from the frontend and replaced them with VisualCircuit ones.

- Now the application is fully automated, we can run python synthesis directly from the NodeJS application using the "Build" option. I have attached a video which is shown [here](www.twitter.com/JdeRobot)

- Created a website for VisualCircuit. [Website]( https://jderobot.github.io/VisualCircuit/)

- About section for VisualCircuit. [About](https://jderobot.github.io/VisualCircuit/about/)

- Wrote the installation guide and how to use it. [Installation Guide]( https://jderobot.github.io/VisualCircuit/install/)

- Added links to VisualCircuit repositories, license and other documentation to the application which can be seen in the video attached at the end.

- Wrote readme.md which can be found [here]( https://github.com/JdeRobot/VisualCircuit/blob/master/README.md)

- Uploaded the clean code to the VisualCircuit's [repository](https://github.com/JdeRobot/VisualCircuit) master branch.
