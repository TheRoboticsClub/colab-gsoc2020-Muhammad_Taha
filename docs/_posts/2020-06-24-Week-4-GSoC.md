### NodeJS Application

The work I did this week was:

1) Removed all IceStudio components from the frontend and replaced them with VisualCircuit ones.

2) Now the application is fully automated, we can run python synthesis directly from the NodeJS application using the "Build" option. I have attached a video which is shown below:

3) Created a website for VisualCircuit. [Website]( https://jderobot.github.io/VisualCircuit/)

- Wrote the installation guide and how to use it. [Installation Guide]( https://jderobot.github.io/VisualCircuit/install/)

4) Uploaded code to VisualCircuit master branch.

5) Wrote readme.md which can be found [here]( https://github.com/JdeRobot/VisualCircuit/blob/master/README.md)

6) Uploaded the clean code to the VisualCircuit [repository's](https://github.com/JdeRobot/VisualCircuit) master branch.
